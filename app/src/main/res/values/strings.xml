        Hong Kong-style milk tea, as known as “Silk Stocking Milk Tea”, is one of the most iconic drinks that represents Hong Kong. It is a fusion that brings western and eastern culture together, just like Hong Kong itself.

        British milk tea was introduced to Hong Kong soon after Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842. As fresh milk is expensive and not commonly used in Chinese cuisine, food stalls replicate their own version of milk tea in a lower cost. It soon became very popular among the grassroots with a booming success. Hong Kong-style milk tea is now a classic drink that can easily be found in different types of restaurants.

Even though the beverage started in grassroots, it takes a lot of knowledge to make a perfect Hong Kong-style milk tea. This much-loved local beverage takes a few steps to make: blending tea leaves, boiling and infusing the tea, force-pouring the tea, brewing the tea and force-pouring the milk. The tea-making technique does not only epitomise the fusion and development of Hong Kong East-meets-West food culture, but also gives a glimpse of how locals live and eat.
